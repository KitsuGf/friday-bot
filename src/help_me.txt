How works the Priority System?
First of all, you need to use number between 1 and 4 to select the priority of the task.```
		:bangbang: = `1 - Maximum Priority.`
		:exclamation: = `2 - High Priority.`
		:grey_exclamation: = `3 - Medium Priority.`
		:question: = `4 - Low Priority.`

```css
How Works the Status System?
Firs of all, you need to know what status exist on the program, there are various keywords to select it.
The words are:
    - todo = Means its without status.
    - await = Mean its waiting to be approved.
    - fixing = Means someone its trying to fix some problem.
    - done = Means the task is done.
    - cancel = Means the task its cancelled for some reason.
    - onwork = Means someone its working on it.```
		:pencil: = `todo`
    	:fingers_crossed: = `await`
    	:wrench: = `fixing`
    	:white_check_mark: = `done`
    	:x: = `cancel`
    	:muscle: = `onwork`
